# #include

Same as the C preprocessor you can use the `#include` command to include other pre file
normally I prefer NAME.ORINGAL_FORMAT.p for main file NAME.ORINGAL_FORMAT.ph for include
file.

# #define

To use `#define` to define macros, just follows this format: `#define [MACROS NAME] "[ITEMS]"`
and to use macros just write the macros NAME.

# Comment

To use comment, you can use `#define COMMENT "Your Comment"`, just make sure you are not useing COMMENT as your content
